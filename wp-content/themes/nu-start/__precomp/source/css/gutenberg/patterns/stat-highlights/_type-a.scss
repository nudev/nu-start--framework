	? This file takes the KNOWN pattern; which is intended to be developed into a LOCKED TEMPLATE, and styles it.
	? This is tightly coupled and will break on changes in the editor
	? Until we move to start really templating; this should be AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE.

	* prebuilding patterns is very easily and flexible; and we can massage the 'correct' choice of blocks this way before 'hardening' things into a template.
