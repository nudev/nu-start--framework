In addition to the esteemed faculty, many students enroll in the master\u2019s programs largely because of the successful co-op program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduate students typically have an experiential work opportunity following their second semester. This could be a six- to eight-month co-op or a three- to four-month summer internship. Those who initially experience co-op may have the opportunity to seek an internship for the following summer, or vice versa.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student participation in experiential education provides enhanced:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Learning, technical expertise, and occupational knowledge<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Confidence, maturity, and self-knowledge<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Job-seeking and job-success skills<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Networking opportunities within your desired career path<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Northeastern\u2019s co-op program is based on a unique educational strategy that recognizes that classroom learning only provides some of the skills students will need to succeed in their professional lives. Our administration, faculty, and staff are dedicated to the university\u2019s mission to \u201ceducate students for a life of fulfillment and accomplishment.\u201d Co-op is closely integrated with our course curriculum and our advising system. The team of graduate co-op faculty within the Khoury College of Computer Sciences provides support for students in preparing for and succeeding in their co-ops.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These multiple connections make co-op at Northeastern an avenue to intellectual and personal growth: adding depth to classroom studies, providing exposure to career paths and opportunities, and developing in students a deeper understanding that leads to success in today\u2019s world.<\/p>\r\n","format":"basic_html"}],"field_requirements":[{"value":"<ul>\r\n\t<li>Online application and fee<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Unofficial undergraduate\/graduate transcripts (you can submit official transcripts from all colleges\/universities attended at the time of admission)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Statement of purpose that should include career goals and expected outcomes and benefits from the program<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Recent professional resum\u00e9 listing detailed position responsibilities<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Three confidential letters of recommendation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Official GRE General Test scores<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Official TOEFL examination scores (international students only)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","format":"basic_html"}],"field_college_link":[{"value":"https:\/\/www.khoury.northeastern.edu\/"}]}]},"program":{"entities":[{"id":"5234","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Align \u2013 Boston"}]},{"id":"5235","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Align \u2013 Seattle"}]},{"id":"5236","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Align \u2013 Silicon Valley"}]},{"id":"5238","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2014 Boston"}]},{"id":"14366","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2014 Seattle"}]},{"id":"14367","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science - Silicon Valley"}]},{"id":"16871","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2014 Charlotte"}]},{"id":"17801","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Align \u2013 San Francisco"}]},{"id":"17912","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science - San Francisco "}]},{"id":"18286","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science - Vancouver"}]},{"id":"18390","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Portland"}]},{"id":"18391","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Computer Science \u2013 Align \u2013 Portland"}]}]}}]},"field_hero_image":[{"target_id":"2364","alt":"","title":"","width":"480","height":"290","uri":"https:\/\/pim.northeastern.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-06\/MSCS-Aligh-hero.jpg"}],"field_hero_video_mp4":[],"field_hero_video_webm":[],"field_overview":[],"field_program_description_long":[{"value":"<p paraeid=\"{7fdb3722-155c-4acd-9171-3fc0d8c8b5ee}{122}\" paraid=\"1757430609\">Computing is an essential element of nearly every human endeavor, and today\u2019s computer scientists are solving many of the world\u2019s problems.
