Single-cell technologies combined with additive manufacturing techniques make possible novel tissue-on-a-chip platforms for pharmaceutical testing.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n","format":"basic_html"}],"field_requirements":[{"value":"<ul>\r\n\t<li>Completed online application form<\/li>\r\n\t<li>$75 application fee<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Two letters of recommendation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Transcripts from all institutions attended<\/li>\r\n\t<li>GRE is not required for terms starting during the 2021-2022 or the 2022-2023 academic years<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, mathematics or other quantitative field<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Statement of purpose<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Resum\u00e9<\/li>\r\n\t<li>TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo for international applicants<br \/>\r\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","format":"basic_html"}],"field_requirements_append":[{"value":"0"}],"field_marketo_form_one":[{"value":"https:\/\/pages.northeastern.edu\/Grad-WEBS-Prog-Page-iFrames-1A-1B_MSBIOE-BION-Simple-POI-1A.html"}],"field_marketo_form_two":[{"value":"https:\/\/pages.northeastern.edu\/Grad-WEBS-Prog-Page-iFrames-1A-1B_MSBIOE-BION-POI-Hidden-1B.html"}],"field_marketo_form_three":[{"value":"https:\/\/pages.northeastern.edu\/Grad-WEBS-Prog-Page-iFrames-2_MSBIOE-BION-No-POI-Form-2.html"}],"field_marketo_form_four":[{"value":"https:\/\/pages.northeastern.edu\/GRAD-WEBS-Prog-Page-iFrames-4_MSBIOE-BION-Find-Out-More-POI-Hidden.html"}],"field_program_experience":[],"field_testimonials":{"entities":[]},"field_faculty_overview":[],"field_students_overview":[],"field_duration":[{"value":"18-24 months"}],"field_accreditation_abbreviation":[],"field_related_program":{"type":"entity","entities":[]},"field_related_program_2":{"type":"entity","entities":[{"id":"18387","title":[{"value":"Master of Science in Biotechnology -
