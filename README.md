# nu-start--framework
TBD - The NU Start Framework - Including a Parent Theme and a Child Theme (optional)

# Important Notes:

# 1: Parent theme uses CodeKit (two separate builds atm) for Blocks and Theme
# 2: Child theme uses the @wordpress/scripts build proces
 
 
 #3: the best workflow will be to make changes to the child theme where it is ideally separated
